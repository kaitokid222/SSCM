Super Safe Crypto Messenger

This is going to be a personal messenger app for me, my friends and all other hardcore paranoids.
The main idea is that we dont trust the phone, the user and the connection.
to solve this issues we want all key factors be validated before the app can get used and otherwise destroy all data
Phone: Validate OS, check for trojans, check for other side channel attacks
User: Biometric Check + password
connection: only communicate through tor.
meanwhile subs for communication got immensely cheap so it isnt a problem to add useless data for every payload byte in a ratio of 1:10000+
